        <h2>Get Out</h2>
        <p>Written and directed by Jordan Peele, "Get Out" is a thought-provoking horror-thriller that touches on racial tensions in America. The film follows Chris, a young Black man, as he visits the family estate of his white girlfriend, Rose. Though everything seems pleasant initially, Chris begins to notice increasingly disturbing behavior from Rose's family and their guests. As he unravels the mysteries of the estate, the film delves into deep-seated racial prejudices and the extent to which they pervade society. The movie was widely acclaimed for its innovative storytelling and strong social commentary, earning Jordan Peele an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.</p>
