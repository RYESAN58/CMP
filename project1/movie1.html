        <h2>Parasite</h2>
        <p>Directed by Bong Joon-ho, "Parasite" is a South Korean film that delves deep into the class disparities in contemporary society. The story revolves around two families — the wealthy Parks and the impoverished Kims — and the latter's cunning plan to become employed by the former. However, their plan spirals out of control, leading to unforeseen and tragic consequences. The movie masterfully blends humor, tension, and social commentary, and it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and later four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.</p>
