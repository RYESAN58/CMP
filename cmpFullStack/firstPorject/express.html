      <h1>Express/Node.js</h1>
      <p>
        <span>Node.js:</span> Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that I've had the opportunity to work with during my internship. It allows server-side JavaScript execution, making it an excellent choice for building scalable and efficient network applications. Node.js employs a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which I found particularly valuable for handling concurrent connections and I/O operations seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my internship, I've used Node.js to develop server-side applications, RESTful APIs, and real-time applications like chat servers. I've become adept at using the Node Package Manager (npm) to manage dependencies and packages efficiently. Node.js's extensive ecosystem and the availability of various libraries and frameworks have enabled me to build robust and high-performance server-side applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Express.js:</span> Express.js, often referred to as Express, is a web application framework for Node.js. I've extensively utilized Express during my internship to simplify the process of building web applications and APIs. Express's minimal and flexible design allowed me to create routes, handle HTTP requests, and implement middleware effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also leveraged Express's support for templating engines like EJS and Pug to generate dynamic views for web applications. Additionally, Express's middleware architecture enabled me to handle tasks such as authentication, data validation, and error handling seamlessly, contributing to the overall stability and security of the applications I've worked on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, my internship experience with Node.js and Express.js has provided me with a strong foundation for server-side JavaScript development. These technologies have allowed me to build scalable, efficient, and feature-rich web applications and APIs, and I'm eager to continue exploring their capabilities and contributing to the ever-evolving world of web development.
