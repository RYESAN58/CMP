      <h1>HTML/CSS</h1>
      <p>
        As a college student with internship experience, I've had the opportunity to work with HTML/CSS at a practical level. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) form the core foundation of web development. Here's an explanation of how I perceive these technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</span> HTML is the backbone of web content. It's a markup language used to structure the elements of a web page, from headings and paragraphs to images, forms, and hyperlinks. During my internship, I gained a strong understanding of HTML's semantic elements, which not only enhance the accessibility of a website but also improve its SEO performance. I've used HTML to create clean and well-organized web pages that adhere to best practices, making them easily readable by both humans and web crawlers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</span> CSS complements HTML by controlling the presentation and layout of web pages. Through my internship experiences, I've become proficient in using CSS to style web content. This involves selecting the right fonts, colors, margins, and padding to create visually appealing and responsive designs. I've also applied CSS principles like flexbox and grid layout to achieve complex page structures and responsive layouts, ensuring the website looks great on various devices and screen sizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, my internship-level experience with HTML/CSS has allowed me to create well-structured and aesthetically pleasing web pages. I understand the importance of clean, semantic HTML for content and have developed skills in using CSS to craft visually appealing and user-friendly websites. These skills have been invaluable in my journey as a web developer, and I look forward to further expanding my knowledge and expertise in this dynamic field.
